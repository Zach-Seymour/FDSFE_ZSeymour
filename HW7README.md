Though the colors in Figure B do not inherently make this a bad plot in itself, the attempt to encircle each ethnicity of each data point creates an added layer of complexity that distracts from the intent of the graph. Also, the lack of clear descriptions of data leads to a lack of understanding of what each figure is trying to show.

It is a simple two-dimensional graph however, it shows the data well. The axes do not require description and the data is clear and straightforward. The numerical values represented on the graph are directly proportional to the size of the change in the numerical value in the data which does not allow for any distortion of values.

In changing the histogram we have made it more clear to the audience what data is being shown. The legend gives a clearer distinction between what demographics are being shown in each part of the graph. The annotations show the mean to give some more specific measures of the data so that a comparison across the two groups can be more easily made. It is also then easy to see the explanation of this as though there are much more male riders the vast majority of them are going on low duration bike trips. This leads to a more skewed average duration whereas the female distribution is much more flat.
