* I took this class because I find Data science very interesting, and after learning some understanding of pandas over the summer I thought it would further my knowledge.
* I really look forward to learning about machine learning and neural networks which I have no experience with prior.
* My hope is that my interest in code and small prior knowledge of using pandas will help me to succeed in the course.
